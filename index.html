      <p>
        Dear God, I acknowledge that I am a sinner, and I am sorry for my sins
        and the life that I have lived. I need Your forgiveness. I believe that
        Jesus Christ shed His precious blood and died for my sins. I am willing
        to turn from my sin. Right now, I confess Jesus as the Lord of my soul.
        With my heart, I believe that God raised Jesus from the dead. This very
        moment, I accept Jesus Christ as my own personal Savior and according to
        His Word, right now I am saved. Thank You, Jesus, for Your unlimited
        grace which has saved me from my sins. Thank You, Jesus, for dying for
        me and giving me eternal life. Amen.
      </p>
